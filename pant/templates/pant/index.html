            <p><b>The Portland Area N-Trak club</b> is a group of N Scale model railroaders who are building and operating the Dairyville Pacific model railroad.
                The Railroad is built on N-Trak modules.  We are located in the Dairyville Village in Alpenrose Dairy at 6149 SW Shattuck Rd, Portland, OR.
                We are now a proud member of the National Model Railroad Association.
                </p>

                <p>We also have a traveling layout that we bring to shows and conventions.  We are making the traveling layout larger by adding some new modules.  
                Watch this space for information about our show schedule.</p>

                <p><b>Work in Progress:</b> Although the main part of the layout is fully operational (see pictures, left) we continue to make improvements and upgrades.
                We have built a large extension to the layout. But, there is some work still to be done.  We have added DCC capability to all the main line loops. We have also rewired and rebuilt the main yard for better operations.</p>
