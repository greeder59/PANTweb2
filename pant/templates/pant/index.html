            <p><b>The Portland Area N-Trak club</b> is a group of N Scale model railroaders who are building and operating the Dairyville Pacific model railroad.
                The Railroad is built on N-Trak modules.  We are located in the Dairyville Village in Alpenrose Dairy at 6149 SW Shattuck Rd, Portland, OR.
                We are now a proud member of the National Model Railroad Association.
                </p>

                <p>We also have a traveling layout that we bring to shows and conventions.  We are making the traveling layout larger by adding some new modules.  
                Watch this space for information about our show schedule.</p>

                <!-- The following will eventually be replaced by member entered information -->

                <p><b>Meeting times:</b>We have changed our meeting times(again).  We now meet each <b>Tuesday</b> night at 7:30 to work on the layout or run trains. New comers and prospective members are welcome to drop by.</p>

                <p><b>Open House:</b> The public is invited to come visit us during our seasonal open houses. We are open during the summer in June through September, 
                and the weeks before Christmas. Watch this space for details.</p>

                <p><b><font color="red">Holiday Hours: </font></b> <font color="green"> 
                Over 10,000 visitors came by this year to see our train layouts, Storybook Lane (live animals) and Santa too! Plan to come by next year. Or this summer.</font>
                </p>

        <!--    <p><b>Summer Open Houses:</b> The public is invited to come visit us this summer.  We will be open  
                Sundays, 1:00 to 4:00 from June through September. </p> -->

                <p><b>Work in Progress:</b> Although the main part of the layout is fully operational (see pictures, left) we continue to make improvements and upgrades.
                We have built a large extension to the layout. But, there is some work still to be done.  We have added DCC capability to all the main line loops. We have also rewired and rebuilt the main yard for better operations.</p>
